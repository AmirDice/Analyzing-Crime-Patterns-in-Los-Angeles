# Analyzing-Crime-Patterns-in-Los-Angeles
## Project Description

Los Angeles, California, draws people from across the globe, presenting numerous opportunitiesâ€”both positive and negative.
In this project, I assist the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) in analyzing crime data to help optimize resource allocation and enhance public safety in the city.

## Analysis Objectives

This analysis aims to uncover key crime patterns by examining the data to determine:

- Peak Crime Hours: Identifying the time of day with the highest crime occurrence.
- Night Crime Hotspots: Pinpointing the areas with the most crimes happening during specific nighttime hours.
- Victim Age Demographics: Analyzing crime distribution across different age groups to understand victimization trends.
